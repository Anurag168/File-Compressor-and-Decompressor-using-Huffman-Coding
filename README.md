# File-Compressor-and-Decompressor-using-Huffman-Coding

A C++ project which uses Huffman Coding Algorithm to compress and decompress an input text file. The intermediate file generated is a binary file with its size reduced significantly and can be extracted with the help of a symbol table which generates while compressing the input file.
